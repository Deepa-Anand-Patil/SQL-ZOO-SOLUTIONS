SELECT NAME, CONTINENT, POPULATION 
FROM WORLD;


2.	Show the name for the countries that have a population of at least 200 million. 200 million is 200000000, there are eight zeros.

SELECT NAME
 FROM WORLD
 WHERE POPULATION >= 200000000;


3.	Give the name and the per capita GDP for those countries with a population of at least 200 million.

SELECT NAME,GDP/POPULATION
FROM WORLD
WHERE POPULATION > 200000000;


4.	Show the name and population in millions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Divide the population by 1000000 to get population in millions.

SELECT NAME, POPULATION/1000000
FROM WORLD
WHERE CONTINENT = 'South America';


5.	Show the name and population for France, Germany, Italy

SELECT NAME, POPULATION

SELECT NAME, POPULATION, AREA
FROM WORLD
WHERE AREA > 3000000 OR POPULATION > 250000000;


8.	Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area (more than 3 million) or big by population (more than 250 million) but not both. Show name, population and area.

Indonesia has a big population but a small area, it should be included.
China has a big population and big area, it should be excluded.
United Kingdom has a small population and a small area, it should be excluded.

SELECT NAME, POPULATION, AREA
FROM WORLD
WHERE (AREA > 3000000 AND POPULATION < 250000000) OR (AREA < 3000000 AND POPULATION > 250000000);


9.	Show the name and population in millions and the GDP in billions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. For South America show population in millions and GDP in billions both to 2 decimal places.

SELECT NAME, ROUND(POPULATION/1000000,2), ROUND(GDP/1000000000, 2)
FROM WORLD
WHERE CONTINENT = 'South America';

WHERE LEFT(NAME,1) = LEFT(CAPITAL,1)
AND NAME <> CAPITAL
